# burgertime2
This app uses Express, MYSQL, ES6 and Handlebars to create a dynamically updating web page that allows users to consume burgers from a menu, add new burgers to consume, and revive all of the burgers that have been eaten. 
The front end was done through Express Handlebars which allows me to dynamically generate front end content for each item in the MYSQL database. Learning how to generate front end content through handlebars was extremely valuable, since a back end that can update a front end can be extremely useful for building apps.
